# UK Carbon Intensity MCP

A naive, didactic, MCP (Model Context Protocol) wrapper implementation of the UK carbon intensity API.

This project provides a simple MCP server that wraps the UK National Grid's Carbon Intensity API, allowing AI assistants and other MCP clients to access real-time and forecasted carbon intensity data for the UK electricity grid.

## Credits

This implementation wraps the **UK Carbon Intensity API**, which is provided by **National Energy System Operator**. The original API provides real-time and forecasted carbon intensity data for Great Britain's electricity grid.

- **Original API**: [UK Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/)
- **API Documentation**: https://carbon-intensity.github.io/api-definitions/
- **Data Source**: National Grid Electricity System Operator (NESO)

The Carbon Intensity API is a free, publicly available service that helps track the environmental impact of electricity consumption in Great Britain. All credit for the underlying data and API design goes to the original developers at Nebo and National Grid ESO.

## Disclaimer

This project is an independent implementation and is not associated with, endorsed by, or affiliated with National Grid Electricity System Operator (NESO) or Nebo. It is a personal project that wraps their publicly available API.
